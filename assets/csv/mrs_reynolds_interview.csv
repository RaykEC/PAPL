finding_body,About finding Lord William's body,"""I couldn't sleep with the storm, so I thought I'd check if Lord William needed anything. He often works late into the night. When I approached his study, I noticed the door was slightly ajar, which was unusual—he always closes it when working. I found him on the floor, clutching his chest. I tried to help him, but... it was too late. That's when I screamed.""",,
tea_preparation,About the tea served to Lord William,"""Yes, I prepared chamomile tea as Lady Victoria suggested—said it might help him sleep better. I prepared it myself using our kitchen supply. Left it on his desk while he was reviewing some papers, around nine o'clock. The tea was a gift from Dr. Thomas to Lady Victoria. She's had it for quite a while and says it tastes wonderful and helps her sleep. Chamomile is known for its calming effects, you see. I saw how tired and stressed Lord William was and hoped it might help a little. Now that I think about it, it was Dr. Thomas who specifically advised me to brew chamomile tea instead of the usual coffee Lord William preferred at night. Said it would be better for his health.""",,
study_visitors,About visitors to Lord William's study,"""I... I did see Mr. James enter the study late last night. He'd been drinking heavily and seemed agitated. I heard raised voices shortly after—they were arguing about the inheritance, I believe. I didn't want to eavesdrop, so I continued with my duties. I didn't mention it earlier because... well, without any evidence, I feared it would seem like I was accusing Mr. James unfairly. The family has always been good to me.""",,
