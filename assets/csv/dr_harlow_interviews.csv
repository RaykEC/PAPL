heart_condition,About Lord William's heart condition and medication,"""William suffered from arrhythmia—irregular heartbeat—that occasionally developed into more serious episodes. The medication he took daily helps regulate his heart's rhythm. I've treated him for over a decade, and while his condition was chronic, it was well-managed with proper care. The medication is digitalis, derived from foxglove. Quite effective, but very particular in its interactions. There are several substances that should never be combined with it, which I've always made clear to William.""",,
research_funding,About research funding cuts,"""Yes, unfortunately. William informed me yesterday evening that he could no longer support my research into cardiac-affecting botanical compounds. Years of work, potentially lost due to his financial missteps. A devastating setback professionally, but I understood his position. These things happen in research.""",will_or_ledger,
chamomile_tea,About the chamomile tea,"""Chamomile? I recommended it to help with his stress and insomnia. Perfectly safe, normally. Though, now that you mention it, certain varieties of chamomile can have mild interactions with heart medications if consumed in large quantities. Nothing fatal on its own, certainly. Was he drinking chamomile last night? Interesting.""",,
